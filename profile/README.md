# HyperCells

Studying hyperbolic lattices with periodic boundary conditions and hyperbolic band theory (using the supercell method).

## Software packages
### [HyperCells](https://github.com/HyperCells/HyperCells)
HyperCells is a GAP package that allows constructing primitive cells and supercells of hyperbolic lattices based on triangle groups and quotients with normal subgroups. 

### [HyperBloch](https://github.com/HyperCells/HyperBloch)
HyperBloch is a Mathematica package for constructing tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices and calculating their band structures using the supercell method.

## Data sets and libraries
- [cell-graph-library](https://github.com/HyperCells/cell-graph-library): A collection of pregenerated cell, model, and supercell model graphs for direct import in GAP, Mathematica, or for use in any other programming language by parsing the text files.
