# HyperCells

Studying hyperbolic lattices with periodic boundary conditions and hyperbolic band theory (using the supercell method).

## Software packages
### HyperCells
HyperCells is a GAP package that allows constructing primitive cells and supercells of hyperbolic lattices based on triangle groups and quotients with normal subgroups. 

### HyperBloch
HyperBloch is a Mathematica package for constructing tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices and calculating their band structures using the supercell method.
